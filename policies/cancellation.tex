\chapter{Cancellation Policy}

\section{Introduction} 
Lens and Lights wants to put on the best show possible for all clients. However,
there are often times where external conditions force the cancellation of an
event. This policy documents the conditions of cancellation, and any additional
terms or fees that may apply.

\section{Cancellation by the Client}
Any Client may cancel their event by submitting a written request to the LNL
Vice President. Cancellation requests received prior to the start of LNL setup
for an event will incur no cost, outside of external rental or movie right fees.
Once setup for an event has started, LNL service fees will still be applied,
subject to discounts at the discretion of the LNL Vice President.

Once an event has begun, the full cost of LNL service fees will apply.

\section{Cancellation by Lens and Lights}
Lens and Lights will put on a good faith effort to make sure that every approved
event happens. However, in some cases, such as if the scope of an event
increases drastically, LNL may elect to not provide services to the event. At
LNLâ€™s sole discretion, it may cancel events if they would present an undue
hardship on its crew. LNL will make every effort to make this determination
prior to the start of setup for an event, in which case no fee will apply,
except for negotiated rental costs that cannot be cancelled.

Lens and Lights may also elect to cancel an event during the event or LNL setup
if the Client or event participants do not treat LNL members or Crew Chiefs with
respect.

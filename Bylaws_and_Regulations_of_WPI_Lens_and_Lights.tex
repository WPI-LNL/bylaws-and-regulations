\chapter{Name and Purpose}

\begin{enumerate}

\item The name of this organization will be WPI Lens and Lights and hereafter referred to as Lens and Lights or the Club.
\item Event production organizations exist to supplement client events with technical services. Lens and Lights seeks to educate and enthuse its membership about the specifics of lighting, sound, and projection services. This is demonstrated through the service of events on the WPI campus and, periodically, to outside organizations.

\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Members}

\section{Classes of Membership} \label{sec:classesofmembership}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \label{itm:wpicommunity} Any member of the WPI community, as defined by the University, who is interested in the purposes of the Club will be eligible for membership.
\item \label{itm:classesofmembership} There will be four classes of membership in the Club: Associate, Active, Away, Alumni.
\subitem Associate Member: A member who is associated with the organization but does not meet the requirements of any other class of membership.
\subitem Active Member: A member who, having met all requirements provided in \cref{itm:activation} of this section, is approved by the Executive Board.
\subitem Away Member: Any member who is granted such status by the Executive Board as allowed by \cref{itm:awaystatus} of this section. Away members are exempt from requirements necessary to retain active status. At the member’s return to the University they will be automatically reclassified as Active.
\subitem Alumni Member: A member who was Active at the time of leaving the University, or who has been granted such status by the Executive Board as allowed by \cref{itm:deactivation} of this section. An Alumni Member may not be reclassified except as provided for in \cref{itm:expulsion} and \cref{itm:reactivation} of this section.
\item \label{itm:association} A member of the WPI community may become an Associate Member by demonstrating an interest in Lens and Lights.
\item \label{itm:activation} An Associate member may only be reclassified as an Active Member (“activated”) with the approval of the Executive Board. The Executive Board will consider any Associate member for activation at the first Executive Board meeting following fulfillment of the following requirements within a semester: (1) attends at least three business meetings and/or Executive Board meetings; (2) works at least five events. In extenuating circumstances, the Executive Board may waive said requirements.
\item \label{itm:deactivation} An Active member may be reclassified as an Associate member (“deactivated”) by the Executive Board. Any Active member who, in A, B, C, or D term, (1) does not work at least four events and (2) does not attend at least one-half of the business meetings will be considered for deactivation by the Executive Board. In determining whether an Active member should be deactivated, the Executive Board will consider the reason for the member’s failure to meet the requirements and the interest shown by the member in the Club. Following a seconded motion to deactive an Active member, the member will be notified of the motion. The motion may not be put to a vote until the next consecutive Executive Board meeting. In special circumstances and upon the request of the member, the Executive Board may elect to reclassify the member as an Alumni Member rather than an Associate Member.
\item \label{itm:expulsion} In matters where a member's actions have been determined to be detrimental to the Club, the Executive Board may revoke their membership in the Club.  The member in question may appeal the decision to the entire Club.
\item \label{itm:awaystatus} An Active Member who will be absent from the University for a period of off-campus academic activity may petition the Executive Board for Away status by submitting a written request which includes the period of time for which Away status is requested, the reason for it, and whether or not the member intends to retain voting privileges. The Executive Board will consider the reason for the request and the Active Member’s involvement in the club when determining whether to grant Away status.
\item \label{itm:alumnistatus} Any Active Member who leaves the University, by graduation or any other means, shall automatically be reclassified as an Alumni Member.
\item \label{itm:reactivation} An Alumni member, who is an Active member of the WPI community as defined by the University, may petition the Executive Board for reclassification as an Active Member. The Executive Board will consider such a petition with the same requirements for activation as those set in \cref{itm:activation} of this section.
\item \label{itm:associategraduation} An Associate member who leaves the University through graduation or other means will be removed from membership in the Club entirely.

\chapter{Card Access Policy}

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this chapter is to outline the different card access levels with regards to Lens and Lights (LNL) and to define a policy for managing these access levels.

\section{Card Access Levels}
There are three (3) access levels in the card access system for Lens and Lights. They are, as the names appear in the card access management system for WPI:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Student Org - Lens n Lights - Current Executive Board
    \item Student Org - Lens n Lights - Event Card (Loaner)
    \item Student Org - Lens n Lights - Office Group
\end{itemize}

These access levels each serve a different purpose as described in the following subsections. They are herein referred to without the preceding ``Student Org - Lens n Lights - ''.

\subsection{Current Executive Board}
The Current Executive Board access level, sometimes colloquially referred to as "online" card access, provides access to many places around campus where LNL operates including but not limited to Alden Hall, Harrington Auditorium, and the Campus Center.

\subsection{Event Card (Loaner)}
The Event Card (Loaner) access level provides the same access as the Current Executive Board access level. While functionally the same, it is important to separate the loaner cards into a different group to ensure when making changes to other groups the loaner cards are not unintentionally affected.

\subsection{Office Group}
This access level provides access to the LNL Office in the Campus Center.

\section{Access Level Management}
This section outlines how the card access levels are managed including who gets each access level and for how long they get that access.

\subsection{Current Executive Board}
This access level is given to current members of the Executive Board, as well as Interim Officers, the Club Advisor, and the Facilities Liaison.

\subsubsection{Officers Elected in C-term}
All officers elected during the C-term elections shall be given this access level for the duration of their term. The expiration date shall be set to one month after the following year's election.

\subsubsection{Interim Officers}
When an interim (or summer) officer takes office, they shall be granted this access level. The expiration date shall be set to one week after the original executive board member retakes their position. The original Executive Board member shall not be removed from Current Executive Board during their leave of absence.

\subsubsection{Facilities Liaison}
To fulfill the duties of their job, the Facilities Liaison regularly requires access to many places around campus where LNL operates. As such, they shall be given the access level of Current Executive Board once the Executive Board confirms their position. The expiration set shall be set to May 31st of their expected graduation year to allow transition time for the incoming Facilities Liaison.

\subsubsection{Advisor}
The advisor of the club shall be given this access level. The expiration date shall not be defined.

\subsection{Event Card (Loaner)}
This access level shall only ever contain the LNL Temporary IDs. Their expiration shall not be defined.

\subsubsection{Lost Temp ID}
In the event an LNL Temporary ID is lost it will be immediately reported to campuscardaccess@wpi.edu as lost to be marked as such in the card access system and deactivated. If found again, the same process may be used to request it be reactivated in the system.

\subsection{Office Group}
This access level shall be given to former members of the Executive Board, the Repeater Manager, and any Licensed Projectionists as given below.

\subsubsection{Former Executive Board Members}
Any individual who has, at any point, sat on the Executive Board of LNL shall receive this access level. To ensure continuous access, individuals shall be given this access level upon taking office with no expiration date defined.

\subsubsection{Repeater Manager}
The Repeater Manager, as appointed by the Executive Board, shall receive this access level with an expiration date set to May 31st of their expected graduation year. If at any point the Repeater Manager steps down from their position, unless they are entitled to this access level per other means they shall have this access level revoked.

\subsubsection{Licensed Projectionists}
Any projectionist who successfully completes a ``practical'' to the satisfaction of the current Head Projectionist shall receive this access level. The expiration date shall not be defined.
